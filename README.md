# TinyDoro

TinyDoro it's a my little project for Telegram.

I will create a bot, which will work as Pomodoro Timer.
Bot will notify user when to start work, or when the time to take a rest.

# Need to do:

1. <strike>If user entered not a number, ask him to enter a number.</strike> (DONE)
2. <strike>User should have posibility to restart timer any time.</strike> (DONE? Need to test in converted version)
3. Convert code to telebot format.
